How To Attach And Mount An EBS Volume To EC2 Linux Instance?

Step 1: Head over to EC2 –> Volumes and create a new volume of your preferred size and type.

Step 2: Select the created volume, right click and select the “attach volume” option.

Step 3: Select the instance from the instance text box.

Step 4: Now, login to your ec2 instance and list the available disks using the following command - lsblk

Step 5: Check if the volume has any data using the following command.

sudo file -s /dev/xvdf

If the above command output shows “/dev/xvdf: data”, it means your volume is empty.

Step 6: Format the volume to ext4 filesystem  using the following command.

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

Step 7: Create a directory of your choice to mount our new ext4 volume. I am using the name “NewVolume”

Step 8: Mount the volume to “newvolume” directory using the following command.

sudo mount /dev/xvdf /NewVolume/

Step 9: cd into newvolume directory and check the disk space for confirming the volume mount.

cd /NewVolume
df -h 

The above command would show the free space in the newvolume directory.

To unmount the volume, you have to use the following command.

umount /dev/xvdf
